    <h1>NNTPChan</h1>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/majestrate/nntpchan">NNTPChan</a> is the combination of the tried and true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">network news transfer protocol</a> and the concept of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">imageboard</a>. The core software, <a href="https://github.com/majestrate/srndv2">SRNDv2</a>, processes posts and then propagates them through out the Overchan network (this is a loose term that describes a federation of NNTPChan nodes).</p>
    <h2>Why NNTPChan?</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of reasons to use NNTPChan rather than legacy centralized imageboards:</p>
    <blockquote class="obligatory">I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as NNTPChan is, in fact, SRNDv2/NNTPChan or as I've recently taken to calling it, SRNDv2 plus NNTPChan. NNTPChan is not a meme machine unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning SRNDv2 system made useful by the SRNDv2 corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full image board as defined by neets.</blockquote>
    <ul class="why-nntpchan no-style">
        <li>
            <h4>NNTPChan is decentralized and distributed</h4>
            <p>Rather than rely on one provider who has full control over the management of the imageboard, NNTPChan allows delegation to virtually an unlimited number of "owners". Anyone can create an nnptchan node and join the Overchan network as they please. One node must simply share its peer information with another node.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>NNTPChan is censorship resistant by design</h4>
            <p>Because of the distributed nature of NNTP, the messages shared accross the network cannot be outright censored. This differs from monolith imageboards in that administration isn't the responsibility of a single organization. Each node maintains its own list of trusted moderators and the rules that determine whether a post should be deleted. Moderation is handled in the form of "control messages" signed with a public key. Nodes can choose to trust a public key which has the effect of accepting and executing control messages (e.g. a delete control message with a trusted signed key would delete the message).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>NNTPChan allows for a customized experience</h4>
            <p>Each node can customize the design (CSS and templates) and from which boards it receives posts. As an example, <a href="https://2hu-ch.org">2hu-ch</a> does not accept posts to or from overchan.porn. NNTPChan also has a JSON API, supports lua scripting, and a development version of SRNDv2 supports webhooks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>NNTPChan is easy to operate</h4>
            <p>NNTPChan requires few resources. The golang library is required to compile SRNDv2. PostgreSQL or Redis is required for storing posts. If you need any help, join us in #nntpchan on freenode or rizon or #overchan on <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/faq#irc">irc2p</a>. </p>
        </li>
       <li>
           <h4>NNTPChan protects user privacy by prioritizing compatibility with anonymizing networks</h4>
           <p>NNTPChan is designed to work with anonymizing networks like Tor and i2p. The majority of the NNTPChan frontends are available only on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web">dark web</a>.</p>
